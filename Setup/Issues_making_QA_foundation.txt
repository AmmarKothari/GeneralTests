Issues making a QA foundation:
1. Skipping small zones -- cant find a foundation that will cut an irregular shaped zone
2. Navigates hitting geofence -- lots of manual intervention
3. Placing spoil regions in good areas
4. Forcing nav to dump still results in swing to dump -- need to investigate further
5. When calculating nav to dump, only remove enough spoil region as needed so the rest can be left for nav to dump (instead of removing the entire reach space)
6. Zonegen fails with error.  Unclear how to fix!

Other Ideas:
Smaller bucket for dorothy (trenching bucket?)
	- smaller scoop length
	- smaller petal angular size


Params to tweak
- annulus width related
	- outer_dig_zone_left_limit
	- outer_dig_zone_right_limit
	- zone_overlap_center

- annulus width and radius related
	- reach_deflation

- skipping zones
	- minimimum_scoop_fullness
	- finish_scoop_fullness
	- min_scoop_length
