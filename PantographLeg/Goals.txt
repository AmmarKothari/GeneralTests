1. Describe the mathematical formula for pantograph legs
2. Create a simulation showing how the leg can move in x and y
	- x only movement
	- y only movement
	- along x=y line movement

3. Figure out the kinematics for the foot staying in a pose and the body moving
4. Create trajectories for the body.
5. (?) Trajectory optimization for the leg.
