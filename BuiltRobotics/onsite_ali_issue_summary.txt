1. SQs not sending information or sending slowly
-- RX and TX were not swapped (TX from sensor went to TX on Comm)
-- Readout from debug_imu.py script can show data even when it is swapped
	-- have script that detects that!

2.  Kernel log shows ali Nuvo has trouble booting up.  Thought it was wifi, but probably just never started.

3.  The pin from the sensor to the ECU was in the wrong location (6 instead of 4).  Tht has the opposite signal as the others.  Maybe it used to be there for redundancy?!?!
