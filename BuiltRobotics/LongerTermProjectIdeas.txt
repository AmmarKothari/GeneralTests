Movement Model for D6
I think for a longer term project, I want switch localizer over to a Kalman Filter that incorporates GPS and IMU data.  I think it will help get rid of the localizer overshoot problem and also help track trajectories better.  From there, i can develop a movement model for the D6 which we can use to predict locations and use in the path planner.   That should make our path planning more unified and robust.  There are some challenges like estimating the effect of dirt on the dozer speed, but I think that they shouldn't be impossible.  With some data collection and testing, the model shouldn't be too difficult.  With a movement model and a time based trajectory, I think that will allow us to increase the speed and take advantage of the gearing.  We can talk more when you get back, but I just wanted to 


Optimization Based Path Planning for D6
-- fixing the navigation stack!




Estimating future pose and avoiding "bad" poses
-- Using lidar to determine where drops occur and avoid them
-- Using terrain map to determine bumps and pre-emptively move blade to cut to grade




Mesh Segmentation with ML
-- Identify mesh points that belong to: Roads, pads, other?



Geofence Scout
-- Using lidar to estimate the height of all the pads in the list and figure out the best path.
