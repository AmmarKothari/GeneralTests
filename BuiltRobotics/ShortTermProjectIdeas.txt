1.  Extract starting height (amount of material to remove) to a log file so it is easier for ops to find.

2.  Fix how location of windrows are determined: no case for overlapping lanes

3. Fix how we set the size of the windrows -- what is too big?

4. Make generate geofence update the files and also update Ricks location in sim

5.  Make terrain map a mesh to make displaying faster

6.  Whatever this Failure is: ERROR|18-10-08 16:20:59.013|t:0096|BuiltActionServer: Exception running action function, discarding goal (/rip_slot_doze_areas)

7.  Change how we navigate between pads after finishing to avoid finished pads.

9.  Rick Sim bag playback

9.  Adding gravity into simulated SignalQuest sensors

11.  Openloop control of the blade

12.  Copy database of information to and from local to master computers

13.  SCP through jump server command

14.  SSH through jump server command
		-- bjoin through jump server??

16.  If navigate crashes, Rick will just careen off into oblivion. -- not sure what the project here is?

17.  Yaw and Linear deflection should be determined at the same time in nav_controller

19.  Turn off viz for terrain maps on cancel or when new goal starts!

20.  On navigate failure, rick should still respond to gamepad!!!

21.  Anytime A* to allow us to replan very quickly!  RRT based planner?

22.  Keep out region that surrounds a rover so someone can walk around with it! -- Region_Factory.py

23.  Kill a node when using bdynamic

24.  Changing braking to acceleration based requests instead of specifying the normalized value in d6_drive_adapater

26.  Should not throw an error if the start pad is not in list.  Should not do anything and list an log.e message.

27.  Change jobsite names for sim and real life

28.  Fix terrain map publisher yamls for all the other machines.  Fix where completed_pads param goes. put it in the right yaml!

29.  Improve bidir gear setting in d6

30.  Fix these lines!
			self._geofence_file = helpers.get_built_pkg_path() + BParam.instance().get('hq_geofence_file')
            self._obstacles_file = helpers.get_built_pkg_path() + BParam.instance().get('hq_obstacles_file')

31.  Change look ahead for is path turning based on current speed of vehicle

32.  fix  def _param(self, name): in d6_drive_adapter (and other drive adapters)

33. have a way to check gear mode from vehicle client

34. Generate SDF from a yaml file

35. Change dozer class names from d6txl to cat_d6txl

36. In commands.py, have the method get_nodes return an alphabetized list

37. Improve dozer calibration script
	- take more points
	- be smarter about moving
	- reset implement to original location after moving it
	- update script to work with new signal quests so we can calibrate the blade!
